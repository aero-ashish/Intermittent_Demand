# Intermittent_Demand

Intermittent Demand has two major uncertainties, variations in the demand size and the demand interval. Accurate and reliable forecasting techniques for intermittent demand can help up us deal with both the above uncertainties. 

The motivation for this project is to improve Croston's method of intermittent demand forecast by classifying the likelihood of the rare event demand occurrence.

The classification of demand occurrence will enable the business to control the inventory size and reduce safety stock by forecasting a dynamic reorder point just before the demand is expected which will overcome the limitations of Croston’s method. 

This project aims to tackle the business problem from an analytic approach, utilizing new age analytical tools such as Machine Learning and Causal Modelling. The proposed method classifies the peaks in the demand to improve inventory control and eventually customer service levels as opposed to Croston’s method that gives an average demand per period.

The intention is to highlight that the machine learning algorithm is more efficient and accurate than traditional forecasting method such as Croston’s method for Intermittent Demand Forecast. The quantitative data of factors influencing the demand is taken and trained using Naive Bayes classifiers. The final objective is to see if machine learning methods can capture underlying factors in Intermittent Demand better than Statistical Methods.
